    "     2. If the car were in a neighboring lane, the distance between our car and the closest car in the possible lane/s is calculated (lines 268-309).\n",
    "     3. Set the cost of turning left and turning right to the distance of the car in that lane. Set the cost of a lane to zero if it were not recommended, otherwise the cost will be maximum (lines 314-327).\n",
    "     4. Adjust the `two_cars_not_close`, flag if needed (lines 324-327).\n",
    "     5. Check if the `too_close` flag is true to change lanes or slow down (line 329).\n",
    "     6. slow down, if needed (lines 332-333).\n",
    "     7. If needed change lanes (lines 335-350).\n",
    "     8. Speed up to the maximum speed, if needed (lines 352-354).\n",
    "2. If the lane had just changes, wait for 77 frames for the car to settle in the new lane (lines 357-360).\n",
    "3. Build the path using the spline library as mentioned in the walkthrough video (lines 363-469)."

In this case the car will decide to move to lane 2 before it gets to lane 1 which increases jerk to more than the maximum allowed.\n",

    "- The flag `two_cars_not_close = false` only if the cars in the only 2 possible lanes are less than 12 S units close from each other and the car is in lane 1 *(lines 324-327)*, in such case the car will slow down until it can move to another lane, otherwise it will move to lane 1 for better options.
